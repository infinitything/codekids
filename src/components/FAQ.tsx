      question: "Is my child too young/old to start?",
      answer: "Our youngest successful graduate was 6, our oldest started at 15. The curriculum adapts to any age and skill level. Our AI-powered learning system automatically adjusts the pace and complexity based on your child's progress and comprehension.",
      category: "Age & Prerequisites"
    },
    {
      question: "What if my child has no tech experience?",
      answer: "Perfect! 89% of our students start with zero coding knowledge. We designed this specifically for complete beginners. The first lessons use visual, drag-and-drop programming that feels more like playing a game than learning code.",
      category: "Getting Started"
    },
    {
      question: "How much time does this require daily?",
      answer: "Most kids spend 20-30 minutes per day, 4-5 days per week. The AI tutor adapts to your family's schedule. You can set custom time limits, and the system will pause automatically. Many parents report their kids asking for 'just 5 more minutes'!",
      category: "Time Commitment"
    },
    {
      question: "What devices do we need?",
      answer: "Any tablet, laptop, or desktop with internet connection. We work on iPad, Chromebook, Windows, and Mac. Our platform is web-based, so there's no software to install. Everything runs in your browser with automatic syncing across devices.",
      category: "Technical Requirements"
    },
    {
      question: "Can parents track progress?",
      answer: "Yes! Real-time dashboard shows completed lessons, time spent, projects built, and skills mastered. You'll receive weekly progress reports, and you can see exactly what your child is learning and building at any time.",
      category: "Parent Features"
    },
    {
      question: "What if my child gets stuck or frustrated?",
      answer: "Our 24/7 AI mentor provides instant help with hints and encouragement. If needed, live expert help is available within 15 minutes. We've designed the curriculum to prevent frustration with bite-sized lessons and immediate positive feedback.",
      category: "Support"
    },
    {
      question: "How is this different from free coding websites?",
      answer: "Free sites lack structure, personalization, and support. CodeKid provides a complete learning path, adaptive AI tutoring, real project portfolios, industry certifications, and dedicated parent support. It's the difference between scattered tutorials and a comprehensive education.",
      category: "Comparison"
    },
    {
      question: "Are the certificates and skills actually valuable?",
      answer: "Our curriculum is designed with input from Google, Microsoft, and other tech leaders. Students have used their CodeKid portfolios to get into top computer science programs, win coding competitions, and even land internships. The projects are real and impressive.",
